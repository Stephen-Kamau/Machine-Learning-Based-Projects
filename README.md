# My Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my personal projects portfolio! This repository serves as a central repo where you can find information and links to various projects I've worked on (some are private). These projects act as proof of my qualifications and experience in deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), data engineering as well as classical machine learning techniques.

Each project showcases a different aspect of my skills, demonstrating my ability to apply advanced machine learning methods to solve complex problems. Most of these projects are stored in private repositories, but I've provided a snapshot of what each project entails. Feel free to explore and learn more about each one!
